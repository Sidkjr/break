### Observations made

In the lesson4-helloworld code, the process of handling transactions is quite simple. Initially, a transaction is submitted to the rpc endpoint along with the necessary params object, such as accounts and fee. If there is any break in the process, the rpc endpoint submits the transaction.

To begin with, we establish a connection to one of the Solana clusters and create a payer account that has some airdropped funds to cover the cost of the transaction. Next, we verify if our program has been deployed and then call the program. Finally, we log the results of the transaction.

Moreover, the accounts in the break project are more advanced and offer support for parallelization and batch size configuration. These accounts are provided to create a file via the useAccountsState React context.
